I currently am a member of the Jiyushinkai and periodically travel to Washington and Arizona to practice. I've been practicing Jiyuhsinkai
  Aikibudo off and on for the past 25 years and hold the rank of nidan. I am not a certified Jiyushinkai teacher, 
  but I am looking for other people in San Francisco who are interested in practicing Jiyushinkai Aikibudo. No experience necessary. I'll be opening up a 
  space sometime in 2026. If this sounds interesting to you, watch this space or send me an email (me@robertjneal.com) and I'll let you know as 
  I get closer to opening.

<h2>Jiyushinkai Aikibudo</h2>

Jiyushinkai Aikibudo mixes modern teaching practices with traditional forms of respect and attention to the practice. Our focus is on 
  understanding the traditional kata and the mechanisms that make them work and testing the efficacy of those techniques through kata 
  (structured practice) and randori (free form practice). We do not have tournaments and are not focused on martial arts as a sport.

<h3>Aikido</h3>

Aikido was founded in 1942 by Morihei Ueshiba (often referred to as O Sensei). Kenji Tomiki, the founder of Tomiki-ryu Aikido, was one 
  of Ueshiba sensei's early students in the art known then as Aikibudo. Tomiki was also a direct student of Jigoro Kano and a high ranking 
  Judoka. Using this background, along with being a professional educator, Tomiki created his own unique way of categorizing and teaching 
  Aikido with an emphasis on self defense.

Jiyushinkai Aikibudo is based on the Tomiki-ryu tradition, which is defined from elements of Aikido and Judo together focusing on systematic 
  explanation. The primary mechanisms for learning principles are through the practice of prearranged standardized forms (kata) and then the 
  application of these techniques in randori (free form). Aikido curriculum also includes study with the jo (staff) and bokken (sword).

<h3>Judo</h3>

Established in 1882, Judo has transformed from a comprehensive martial art into a modern Olympic sport. As a martial art, Judo incorporated 
  the effectiveness of Japanese Jujutsu systems while emphasizing scientific ways to practice. As a sport, Judo has reached thousands of 
  people and has become an Olympic event. During that process of transformation, several techniques have been modified and or removed for 
  the purpose of furthering safety. Judo is big enough to be both of these things. Our focus, however, revolves on preserving the martial 
  and spiritual study of Judo.

The Jiyushinkai Aikibudo curriculum of study has retained many components from its Judo background. This includes studies of Kodokan based 
  ukemi (falling), Judo throws (nage waza), locks (kansetsu waza), chokes (shime waza), ground work (newaza) and striking (atemi waza). The 
  spiritual ideals of Judo, seiryoku zenyo (best use of energy) and jita kyoei (mutual benefit), are defining principles of our practice. The 
  influence of Kano sensei can be felt in every aspect of our training.
